Motivation for this code and application was to try to understand and implement the Hexagonal Architecture - also called Port and Adapter Architecture.
Side motivation was to try SparkJava (https://sparkjava.com/) - a micro framework for creating web applications.

The implementation is:
- the code in Hexagonal Architecture way
- CSS and jQuery for frontend styling and functionality
- Sqlite Database for persistence (https://sqlite.org)
- a Web application using SparkJava and Apache Velocity technology (https://velocity.apache.org/)
- a CSV loader to load data into the database
